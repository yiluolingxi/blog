### Final Notes

- **Top advantages** of leading platforms: broad exposure, strong remote-branding, curated listings, trusted quality.
    
- **Trade-offs**: Paid access (FlexJobs), less diversity (tech-heavy boards), or limited scale (niche sites).
    
- **Use Strategy**: For best results, job seekers often combine top boards (like FlexJobs, We Work Remotely, Remote OK) plus niche ones aligned to their tech stack or region.
