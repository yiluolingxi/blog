一，科学寻找开源的方法：
**工具**
GitHub代码活跃度 + Dune链上采用率 ≈ 判断项目的真实热度与健康度
[Dune — Crypto Analytics Powered by Community.](https://dune.com/home)

Dune无法直接追踪代码开源性，需手动验证GitHub仓库
部分项目可能伪装开源（如仅开放部分模块），需检查代码提交历史。
高交易量可能由刷量导致（如低Gas链上的Farm项目）
避免被表面数据（如高TVL、GitHub Star数）误导
**多维度交叉验证**
结合链上数据（Dune）+代码活跃度（GitHub）+社区讨论（Discord/Twitter）或外部榜单（如 DappRadar）

Telegram群组、Discord频道、设置Google Alerts以便实时接收有关Web3的关键字更新。

方法1：
**搜索词汇**
**技术栈相关**：`web3`, `blockchain`, `ethereum`, `solidity`, `rust`, `substrate`, `ipfs`, `nft`, `defi`, `dao`, `smart contract`, `dapp`

方法2：
**GitHub Trending**：访问 [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending)，选择语言（如 `Solidity`）或时间段（日/周/月）查看热门项目
**为什么要在 Trending 页面搜索 Web3 关键词？**
- **发现新兴项目**：Trending 页面能快速捕捉到最近流行的 Web3 项目（例如新发布的工具、协议或框架），而传统按 Stars 排序可能遗漏短期爆款。
    
- **避免过时信息**：Web3 领域技术迭代快，Trending 能优先展示近期活跃项目。

方法3：
 **第三方 GitHub Trending 客户端**
#### **(1) GitHubPopular**

Web3 Industry Trends and Hotspots Report (Spring 2025)

# Web3 Trends (Feb–Apr 2025)

## 1. Hot Topics and Market Narratives

- **Memecoin Mania & Volatility:** Speculative memecoin launches continued to drive extreme swings. Binance reports that Solana’s early 2025 memecoin rally (fueled by new token airdrops) gave way to a crash – Solana’s revenue fell ~80% and its token dropped ~15–39% in recent months after network congestion​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--april-2025-2809984286117151745#:~:text=drawing%20usage%20away%20from%20Ethereum%E2%80%99s,by%20the%20funding%20mechanism%2C%20which)​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--february-2025-6996114716886554556#:~:text=January%20had%20notable%20winners%20and,a%20key%20player%20in%20DeFi). Terra-class memecoins (e.g. $LIBRA on Solana) collapsed, erasing billions in value and pushing traders back into stablecoins​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--march-2025-4333224542541210966#:~:text=ETH%20plunged%2020,November%202024%2C%20as%20traders%20bridged)​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--april-2025-2809984286117151745#:~:text=drawing%20usage%20away%20from%20Ethereum%E2%80%99s,by%20the%20funding%20mechanism%2C%20which). This year’s “memecoin season” highlights both speculative hype and the fragility of tokens lacking real utility.
    
- **Stablecoins & Regulation:** Steady growth in stablecoins persisted amid regulatory shifts. USDC continued to gain market share – rising from 20% to ~25.7% of stablecoin supply in Q1​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=Despite%20this%20DeFi%20contraction%2C%20the,issuers%2C%20including%201%3A1%20reserve%20backing) – partly driven by regulatory clarity. In March, the U.S. **GENIUS Act** advanced through Congress, imposing strict 1:1 reserve rules on stablecoin issuers (boosting confidence in compliant assets)​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=Despite%20this%20DeFi%20contraction%2C%20the,issuers%2C%20including%201%3A1%20reserve%20backing). Meanwhile, the **OCC** formally authorized banks to custody crypto, and the SEC signaled more openness to crypto ETFs​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=,markets%20over%20the%20past%20month)​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=Image). These moves, combined with global interest, helped stablecoins’ total market cap grow ~4–5% in early 2025, even as risky crypto fell​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=Despite%20this%20DeFi%20contraction%2C%20the,issuers%2C%20including%201%3A1%20reserve%20backing).
    
- **Ethereum vs. Layer2 Scaling:** Ethereum’s mainnet usage showed signs of strain as Layer‑2 solutions grew. Binance notes “growing concerns” that L2 rollups are drawing activity away from Ethereum’s mainnet, coinciding with a ~19% drop in ETH’s price in April​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--april-2025-2809984286117151745#:~:text=Among%20the%20biggest%20losers%2C%20ETH,by%20the%20funding%20mechanism%2C%20which). By contrast, some L2 ecosystems (like Arbitrum and Optimism) saw surges in user activity. Notably, Coinbase’s **Base** L2 announced aggressive 2025 goals – 25 million users and $100B TVL – with features like a smart-wallet and AI-driven apps​[coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/c37b5c82-ca94-4fbe-8b4a-be6d4fc05e85#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20press%20release,total%20assets%20on%20the%20platform). This highlights the hot narrative of ETH scaling via optimistic and ZK rollups, and the race to onboard new users with easier wallets.
    
- **DeFi Security & Incidents:** Major security events dominated headlines. The Bybit exchange suffered a **$1.46 B** hack (Lazarus-led) in late February, the largest on record​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--march-2025-4333224542541210966#:~:text=,a%20drop%20in%20memecoin%20activity). The hacker’s use of ParaSwap (a DeFi DEX aggregator) to swap stolen stETH for ETH raised a governance debate: Bybit formally **asked the ParaSwap DAO to return ~$100k** of transaction fees earned from the hack, splitting the community​[cryptonews.com](https://cryptonews.com/news/bybit-asks-paraswap-dao-to-return-100000-in-hack-related-fees/#:~:text=Crypto%20exchange%20Bybit%20has%20confirmed,the%20%2093%20in%20history)​[cryptonews.com](https://cryptonews.com/news/bybit-asks-paraswap-dao-to-return-100000-in-hack-related-fees/#:~:text=It%20seeks%20the%20DAO%E2%80%99s%20approval,list%20of%20transactions%20for%20reference). This controversy underscored a hot topic: how decentralized communities handle hack recoveries (traceability of funds vs. immutability of code).
    
- **Token Proliferation:** Social media buzz pointed to an explosion of new tokens. Binance Research noted that by end-2025 there could be **100 million** crypto assets in existence​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--february-2025-6996114716886554556#:~:text=%2A%20The%20Trump%20administration%27s%20pro,end), reflecting the huge proliferation of coins (many memecoins or small project tokens). Investors and developers debated whether this dilution helps “democratize finance” or mainly adds noise.
    
- **Mainnet Upgrades & News:** Tron and BNB Chain grabbed attention with technical upgrades. In March Tron launched a “gas-free” USDT feature (transaction fees can be paid directly in USDT), simplifying stablecoin transfers​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--march-2025-4333224542541210966#:~:text=While%20Tron%E2%80%99s%20TRX%20declined%202.7,processing%20100%20million%20transactions%20daily). BNB Chain unveiled a 2025 roadmap (sub-second block times, AI-smart wallets, 100 M tx/day goals) to push mass adoption​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--march-2025-4333224542541210966#:~:text=scalability%20continues%20to%20grow,processing%20100%20million%20transactions%20daily). These initiatives were widely discussed on Twitter/Reddit as examples of networks jockeying for everyday user growth.
    
- **NFT Market Dynamics:** NFT headlines were mixed. Trading volumes plunged (~41% drop in Feb, followed by a further ~12% decline in Mar)​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--march-2025-4333224542541210966#:~:text=In%20February%202025%2C%20the%20NFT,based%20NFT%20sales%20volume%20dropped)​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=In%20March%202025%2C%20the%20NFT,2023%20amid%20broader%20macroeconomic%20uncertainty), bringing buyer counts to lows unseen since 2021. However, OpenSea’s native token launch (SEA) and platform upgrade propelled its market share from ~25% to ~72% of NFT volume in Feb​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--march-2025-4333224542541210966#:~:text=In%20February%202025%2C%20the%20NFT,based%20NFT%20sales%20volume%20dropped). Meanwhile, some branded NFTs _soared_: Panini’s officially licensed sports card NFTs surged **259%** in March to become a top-10 chain by volume​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20Panini%E2%80%99s%20America%20NFTs,for%20their%20authenticity%20and%20exclusivity). High-profile partnerships (Sandbox × Jurassic World, Azuki × Michael Lau, Sony’s Soneium with LINE) also drove social buzz​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=Despite%20the%20broader%20market%20pullback%2C,apps%2C%20signaling%20ongoing%20innovation), highlighting continued interest in entertainment/gameFi NFT use-cases even as pure speculation cooled.
    
- **Decentralized Social & Web3:** Interest in Web3 social platforms (SocialFi) and decentralized identity was growing. Developers frequently cited a coming “explosion” of decentralized social networks in 2025​[dev.to](https://dev.to/leo_scott_357f10236fabe00/preparing-for-web3-in-2025-what-developers-and-investors-need-to-know-k7h#:~:text=3,based%20economies), aiming to solve issues of data ownership. This trend was reflected in talks of new projects and experiments (e.g. discussions of Lens Protocol, Farcaster, and Sony’s Web3 social mini-apps in gaming).

TVL and usage surged around high-volatility events. **Traction:** Its DAO was in the spotlight after the Bybit hack: the $1.5B hack attacker routed stolen stETH through ParaSwap, generating ~$100k in fees. The ParaSwap DAO faced a proposal (made by Bybit) to **return these hack-related fees**​[cryptonews.com](https://cryptonews.com/news/bybit-asks-paraswap-dao-to-return-100000-in-hack-related-fees/#:~:text=Crypto%20exchange%20Bybit%20has%20confirmed,the%20%2093%20in%20history). This incident highlighted ParaSwap’s on-chain governance: some community members argued the DAO should keep the bounty (10%), while others urged aiding hack recovery​[cryptonews.com](https://cryptonews.com/news/bybit-asks-paraswap-dao-to-return-100000-in-hack-related-fees/#:~:text=Crypto%20exchange%20Bybit%20has%20confirmed,the%20%2093%20in%20history). **Outlook:** ParaSwap’s handling of this event will set precedents for DeFi governance. The protocol plans feature upgrades (gas optimizations, new aggregator integrations) and is expanding TVL through yield-farming incentives.
    
- **The Sandbox (GameFi / Metaverse):** The Sandbox is a community-driven 3D voxel metaverse. **Purpose:** Enable users to create, own, and monetize virtual gaming experiences and assets (NFTs). **Innovation:** Combines a game engine with user-owned land NFTs and avatars. **Adoption:** It boasts millions of users on its 3D worlds platform and a large ecosystem of creators. **Traction:** In Q1, Sandbox announced a **Jurassic World** partnership, allowing dinosaur-themed experiences in its metaverse​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=Despite%20the%20broader%20market%20pullback%2C,apps%2C%20signaling%20ongoing%20innovation). This corporate tie-up (with Universal/Amblin) highlights Sandbox’s mainstream appeal. **Community:** Thousands of landowners and game developers build on Sandbox (supported by their $3B ecosystem fund). **Outlook:** The Sandbox team is rolling out social hubs and DeFi features (in-game economies, staking) to drive further engagement. It faces competition (e.g. Decentraland, Roblox NFT experiments) but is a bellwether for GameFi. (See partnership news​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22626973895393#:~:text=Despite%20the%20broader%20market%20pullback%2C,apps%2C%20signaling%20ongoing%20innovation).)
    
- **Sony’s Soneium (SocialFi / Web3 Mini-Apps):** Sony launched _Soneium_ as a mobile app for NFTs and mini-apps.

## 3. Pain Points and Challenges

- **User Experience & Onboarding:** A recurring complaint is poor UX for new users. Industry writers point out that **wallet setup and understanding gas fees** remain daunting: e.g. beginners complain “Metamask set up – now what?”, or abandon swaps at terms like “liquidity pool”​[dev.to](https://dev.to/resourcefulmind/why-web3-keeps-losing-users-and-how-we-actually-fix-it-in-2025-12g#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D). Many projects still cater to “crypto insiders,” neglecting guided tutorials or fiat rails​[dev.to](https://dev.to/resourcefulmind/why-web3-keeps-losing-users-and-how-we-actually-fix-it-in-2025-12g#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)​[dev.to](https://dev.to/resourcefulmind/why-web3-keeps-losing-users-and-how-we-actually-fix-it-in-2025-12g#:~:text=This%20isn%E2%80%99t%20nitpicking%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20make,more%20glaring%20the%20fallout%20becomes). This gap costs projects real users: Web3 daily active wallets ~26M (end 2024), but many are dormant or bots​[dev.to](https://dev.to/resourcefulmind/why-web3-keeps-losing-users-and-how-we-actually-fix-it-in-2025-12g#:~:text=This%20isn%E2%80%99t%20nitpicking%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20make,more%20glaring%20the%20fallout%20becomes).
    
- **Ecosystem Fragmentation:** Developers cite the fragmentation of blockchains as a major hurdle​[dev.to](https://dev.to/leo_scott_357f10236fabe00/preparing-for-web3-in-2025-what-developers-and-investors-need-to-know-k7h#:~:text=1,Polkadot%2C%20and%20new%20interoperability%20standards). Multiple incompatible networks mean fragmented liquidity and tools. Cross-chain bridges exist, but trust issues (security of bridges) persist. Also, the sheer **number of chains** (Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Aptos, etc.) forces users to choose networks, diluting community focus.
    
- **Security and Hacks:** High-profile hacks (Bybit, plus ongoing DeFi exploits) remain a top concern. Users worry about smart-contract vulnerabilities and key security (e.g. 2024 saw several DeFi project hacks and exploits). Even reputable projects like ParaSwap can unknowingly become vehicles for stolen funds (as happened). The incident raised community debate: a Bybit-forced DAO action might set a dangerous precedent (undermining “code is law”) or encourage custodians to recover losses. This tension is a hot issue among developers and investors.
    
- **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Despite recent progress, global regulation is still murky. Projects fret over classification of tokens and compliance costs. U.S. SEC actions (e.g. earlier threats on DeFi platforms) have largely eased (SEC withdrew its DeFi “broker-dealer” appeal​[binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/research/binance-research-key-trends-in-crypto--march-2025-4333224542541210966#:~:text=In%20February%202025%2C%20DeFi%E2%80%99s%20Total,This%20shift%20suggests%20that)), but uncertainty remains for tokens without clear legal guidance. The potential for future adverse regulation (EU/US crypto laws still evolving) remains a pain point.
    
- **Market Sentiment & Over-Speculation:** The frenetic issuance of new tokens (100M by year-end) and meme hype is a double-edged sword. While it attracts newcomers, it also leads to confusion and distrust among serious investors. DeFi experts on forums lament that the “community is whitepaper-driven” and overpriced coins abound. NFT collectors similarly experienced painful losses as speculative prices collapsed (e.g. BAYC floor down 50–60% in Q1).
    
- **Blockchain Limitations:** Common developer complaints include persistent gas costs on major chains (though down from peak, they still deter small trades), limited smart contract expressiveness on some chains (e.g. no native finality on some PoS chains), and absence of account abstraction by default (users still need meta-txes or contract wallets). These technical limitations keep pushing growth to L2s.
    

## 4. Hot & Emerging Technologies

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) & ZK Rollups:** ZK proofs continue to gain traction as a scaling and privacy solution. ZK Rollups (like zkSync, StarkNet, Polygon zkEVM) have become fully EVM-compatible, allowing high-speed transactions with on-chain validity proofs. Academic and engineering blogs note that ZK systems are maturing: recent “ZK-EVM” papers (e.g. from Polygon and Ethereum research) show performance leaps that may enable blockchain throughput far above current levels. We expect more DeFi and NFT platforms to migrate to ZK rollups in coming months, as the tech moves from testnets into mainstream (e.g. ZK L2s launching tokens or grants).
    
- **Account Abstraction & Smart Wallets:** **EIP-4337** (account abstraction) is now live on Ethereum: this allows “smart contract wallets” that can batch gas, offer social logins, or pay fees with tokens. While not widely visible yet, developer forums report active exploration: wallets like Argent and Stackup are piloting gasless-transaction flows. Account abstraction promises to blur the line between EOAs and contracts, enabling features like paymasters (sponsors for gas) and multi-sig wallets with improved UX.
    
- **AI × Web3 Integration:** AI integration is a booming topic. Ethereum researchers and conferences are exploring AI-driven dApps and agents. For instance, the **agentic web** concept envisions autonomous AI “agents” that own wallets and execute trades or actions on behalf of users​[hashtagweb3.com](https://hashtagweb3.com/10-big-ideas-in-web3-for-2025/#:~:text=AI%20agents%20will%20revolutionize%20decentralized,autonomously%20managing%20complex%20financial%20tasks). Startups are already applying machine learning to optimize on-chain portfolios, detect fraud, and personalize DeFi. Decentralized AI marketplaces (for datasets and compute) are also emerging. On social media, AI-powered NFT art generators and trading bots are hot buzzwords. The potential of AI to analyze on-chain data and automate strategies is cited as a key future inflection (Blends of AI and oracles, on-chain identity bots, etc.).
    
- **Cross-Chain & Interoperability:** With the rise of multiple L1s, bridging tech and interoperability protocols are advancing. IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) in Cosmos and similar tech (Polkadot parachains, Ethereum “Supernets”) are under active development. Developer blogs highlight modular blockchain frameworks (e.g. Celestia’s data availability) as the next layer of scaling. Projects like **EigenLayer** (on Ethereum) promise new trust networks via restaking, enabling cross-chain security.
    
- **Web3 Infrastructure:** Emergent tools like decentralized storage (Arweave, IPFS pinning markets), and decentralized identity (SelfKey, ENS) are maturing. Dev forums discuss account abstraction libraries, wallet SDKs (OnchainKit on Base), and new smart contract languages (Move, Sway for Fuel). Web3 APIs (The Graph, Covalent) continue to evolve to serve the data needs of complex dApps. Institutional investors are eyeing these as foundational.
